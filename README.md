# Uninitialized State Access in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it's initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

Accessing state before it's fully initialized can lead to unexpected behavior and errors, especially during the initial rendering of the component. This issue typically arises with asynchronous operations or complex state updates.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the state variable is properly initialized before attempting to access it.  This usually involves using conditional rendering or checking for null/undefined values.
